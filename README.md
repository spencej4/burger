# Burger App

## Description:
This app creates a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM. It utilizes MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### Overview

* Burger lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has an 'Eat!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
